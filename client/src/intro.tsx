      <h1>Our beloved Mother turns 80 this year!</h1>

      <p>To Christ Jesus be the glory!</p>
      <p>
        Come help us celebrate the 80th birthday of our beloved mother,
        grandmother, sister, aunty, cousin and friend to many, Mrs Ethel Ulasi, who 
        on 31st October 2025, will have been alive to witness the earth rotate around 
        the sun 80 times. How amazing is that! We are truly grateful to God and our 
        Lord Jesus Christ, for blessing our dear mother with
        such a long and fruitful life and we pray our good God will continue to
        satisfy her with His everlasting goodness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Come join us as we celebrate! Let's eat some delicious food, drink until
        we are merry and <p><span>DANCE, DANCE, DANCE!</span></p>
